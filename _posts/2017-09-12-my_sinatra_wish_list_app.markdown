Starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. One of my favorite parts of coding is the actual creation of a web app. The front end design, making everything look nice and user friendly is so satisfying. The instant gradification of seeing your code transform an app is powerful. I also enjoy all the back end work which actually pays the bills and is equally if not more impressive, actually more, but there is a limited population of people who can actually respect and understand the work you did and how proud of you they actually should be. So that leads me to why I really enjoyed the building of my Sinatra app, and why I am looking forward to my projects in the future. My Sinatra app is a simple Wish List app, the index page welcomes the user and ask's if you'd like to log in or sign up, after you finish this process you are logged in to you home page. Your home page displays your current wish list, and gives you options to make a new wish for your list or view everyones wishes. The page for everyone's wishes is essentially a feed of every users wish and what they are wishing them for. The user also has the ability to edit or delete his/her wishes. Overall I am happy with the app, it took my sometime to get the has_many through an join table relationships working correctly but once I did I felt empowered and that I was ready to take on rails. Although I am in the thick of it now and the forms are getting fairly tricky at the moment, but that is for my next post.
