I had a hard time coming up with the idea of what to create for my Rails assignment, I think my brain power was more focused on going over all the things I have learned and how I can properly implement them in the assignment. My mind was being used for the coding I was going to have to do and not the creativity of what I could do with it. This is something I am excited to change in the future once my fundamentals are strongly developed. Then I will be able to use the tools I have learned to creatively build something I am excited about. 

As for my rails assignment, I have built a recipe app, it is a fairly simple app with the ability to persist users, recipes and ingredients.  You can have different users, who can add recipes and ingredients to the application. They can view the recipes they have added to app, and view all the recipes and ingredients any user added to the app. I had trouble at first using the devise gem to add sign in and log in capabilities to the app, I didn't have problem with adding the devise gem and getting it to work but I had trouble figuring out how I could the use the Users in the app as Chef's and display them with an index and show page. Since the Devise gem does so much work for you I had trouble figuring out how to add on different functions to the gem that were not initially given to you. But with enough reading and google searching I came to my answer. I also added an Omniauth gem which allows users to sign in using their twitter out of their twitter credentials they I has done, but I achieved this and was able to get the users nickname from twitter. I have added some filters to the index pages to help display the indexes in certain orders, and also have validations on my CRUD actions. Using my app in the browser I feel it is working fairly well, I am happy where it is at, although I am sure there will be some refactoring that can be done and some improvement which will be pointed out in my review. I am going to keep working on my refactoring as I get ready for my meeting and try and tighten up on all the aspects of DRYing up my app. 

I am starting to look forward to the JavaScript portion of the schooling, and excited to do some more frontend work.
