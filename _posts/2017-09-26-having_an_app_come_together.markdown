Over the last year of coding and taking the online web development course from Flatiron school the one thing I have realized about myself is the areas of coding which bring me the most joy. All aspects of coding are incredibly rewarding, especially the satisfaction of solving a problem that has been plaguing you. But I have started to understand more about what attracted me to coding in the first place. The instant gratification of making a app more user friendly has really intrigued me, the building of apps that a user can easily understand and interact with has come to stand out with me as where my interests lie. A quote that always sticks in my mind is “Any product that needs a manual is broken” – Elon Musk said this and I think it translates perfect into app design, your app should be fool proof for anyone to use. I have had a lot of frustrating moments throughout my learning curve but I am happy that I can see a path to the areas I enjoy. My interest in user interface and interaction may stem from my marketing background, which may combine perfectly for my areas of interest as I pursue my career.
